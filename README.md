 Code for the September module Programming for Social Sciences: Core Skills in Python.

This repositary contains the final code produced for the September 2020 module "Programming for Social Scientists: Core Skills in Python". The module focused on providing a basis to the Python language, with code typically produced in Spyder (part of the Anaconda package) due to the benefits of using a cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE), as opposed to through the simplified Python shell command.

The aim of the code is to produce an Agent-Based Model (ABM); simulating the behvaiour of agents as they move around in the virtual environment - the environment cosists of data which was read in using the in.txt file in this repository. The simulation of agent behaviours was achieved through an object-orientated approach due to the production of the Agent class which defines the behaviours of all instances of the agent. Please see the agentframework.py file to view the formulation of this agent class.
