# PFSS-Python
 Code for the September module Programming for Social Sciences: Core Skills in Python.

## Repositary Contents
This repositary contains the final code produced for the September 2020 module "Programming for Social Scientists: Core Skills in Python". The module focused on providing a basis to the Python language, with code typically produced in Spyder (part of the Anaconda package) due to the benefits of using a cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE), as opposed to through the simplified Python shell command.

The aim of the code is to produce an Agent-Based Model (ABM); simulating the behvaiour of agents as they move around in the virtual environment - the environment cosists of data which was read in using the in.txt file in this repository. The simulation of agent behaviours was achieved through an object-orientated approach due to the production of the Agent class which defines the behaviours of all instances of the agent. Please see the agentframework.py file to view the formulation of this agent class.

Alternatively, the model.py file outlines the main code used alongside the agentframework.py file - if attempting to run the model, both files must exist in the same directory, and the agentframework.py file must be imported at the top of the model.py file in order for the code to function correctly. Although this is included in the attached file, please bear this in mind if difficulties are encountered during early stages.

Generally, textual comments have been added which are signified when chunks of code are preceded by the hash key, these comments typically explain to readers what the following section of code is intended to do.
